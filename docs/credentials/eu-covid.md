# EU Digital COVID Credentials

The system supports the **EU Digital COVID Credentials** both for storing and verifying them with the wallet and verifier applications.
The system supports generating credentials using exactly the same format as the `EU Digital COVID Credential`, but in our case the public keys are stored in the blockchain, together with the identities of all entities authorised to issue credentials.

The format and interoperability guidelines are defined in the related documentation from the EU.
