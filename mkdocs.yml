  PrivacyCredentials is a generic credential system which is designed to be secure, privacy-preserving, scalable, performant and robust. It is designed specifically for some important use cases where physical, on-person verification of identity of holder is needed and where normal W3C Verifiable Credential flows are not fully suitable as they are normally designed currently.
